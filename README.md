# ARI2201---Bricks-Breaker-Game


In my ARI2201 Individual Assigned Practical Task, I embarked on a project titled 'Playing games via hand gestures'. I implemented this innovative concept in the popular game Bricks Breaker, enabling players to control the game using hand gestures. Utilizing Teachable Machine, I trained a data model to accurately interpret the gestures, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game. Clear instructions are provided at the beginning to guide players on how to play using hand gestures. The project's implementation was achieved using JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and interactive gaming experience.
